# Map My World Robot
## Abstract

This paper implements Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique to construct a map of a given environment. A Real Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) approach was taken for accomplishing this task. Initially, a 2d occupancy grid  and 3d octomap was created from a provided simulated environment. Next, a personal simulated environment was created for mapping as well. In this appearance based method, a process called Loop Closure is used to determine whether a robot has seen a location before or not. In this paper, it is seen that RTAB-Map is optimized for large scale and long term SLAM by using multiple strategies to allow for loop closure to be done in real time and the results depict that it can be an excellent solution for SLAM to develop robots that can map an environment in both 2d and 3d.

## Introduction

In SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), a robot must  construct a map of the environment, while simultaneously localizing itself relative to this map. This problem is more challenging than localization or mapping, since neither the map nor the robot poses are provided making this problem a 'chicken or a egg' problem. With noise in the robot's motion and measurements, the map and robot's pose will be uncertain, and the errors in the robot's pose estimates and map will be correlated. The accuracy of the map depends on the accuracy of the localization and vice versa. Given a series of sensor observations over discrete time steps , the SLAM problem is to compute an estimate of the agentâ€™s location and a map of the environment.
In this paper, two simulation environments were provided where SLAM was performed. The robot was successfully able to localize itself and map the 3d world. The benchmark environment is called kitchen-dining (Figure 1) and the second environment is that of a cafeteria called sagar-cafe (Figure 2).
