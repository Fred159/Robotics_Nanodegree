# Udacity-Robotics
These are work and projects I developed as a part of [Udacity Robotics Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/robotics).


In this project, I'll:

- Write code to autonautonomously map a simulated environment, search for samples of interest, and pick them up. 
- Wse Kinematics and ROS to manipulate a robotic arm in simulation with six degrees of freedom to pick up an object from one location and place it in another without running into obstacles. 
- Program a Willow Garage, two-armed PR2 robot to locate an object in a cluttered environment and then relocate it to a new location
- Train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation and then issue commands to a drone to follow that target. 
- Use Monte Carlo localization (particle filter method) to localize a robot in a mapped environment.
- Use Simultaneous Localization and Mapping to Map a new environment and localize the robot with respect to it.
- Use deep reinforcement learning to train a Kuka-arm to grab an object from the ground.
- Use Probabilistic search methods to make a home service robot which can navigate through an environment.
